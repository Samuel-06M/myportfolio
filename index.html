        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am a software engineering enthusiast with a background in procurement and supply chain management. I graduated from Kirinyaga University, where I first developed a strong interest in software engineering. During my time at university, I was drawn to the potential of technology to optimize processes and improve efficiencies in supply chains.
            <br>
            To pursue my passion for software development, I enrolled in the Power Learn Project (PLP), a comprehensive learning management system. Through PLP, I gained a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practical skills, allowing me to bridge my knowledge of supply chain management with innovative technological solutions.
            <br>
            My journey in software engineering has equipped me with a unique blend of skills and perspectives, and I am excited to continue exploring how technology can transform and enhance various industries.
